<h1 style="color:PaleGoldenrod;">Black Canyon Restaurant</h1>
<p><img src="blackcanyon.jpg" alt="Blackcanyon" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
<p style="background-color:Cornsilk;">After graduating from high school, I did a part -time job at a leading restaurant,
Black Canyon Restaurant in Aman Central shopping center, Alor Setar Kedah (1 December 2018 - 31 January 2019). 
I work as one of the waiters in the restaurant. From here, I gained experience in managing food and beverage services 
and got to know a lot of food that comes from Thailand.</p>

<h1 style="color:PaleGoldenrod;">Marrybrown Restaurant</h1>
<p><img src="marrybrown.jpg" alt="Marrybrown" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
<p style="background-color:Cornsilk;">In early 2021, during the semester break in March, I took the initiative to earn some pocket money during the semester break,
so I got a job offer at Marrybrown Star Parade, Alor Setar Kedah on March 1, 2021 until October 5, 2021. Due to the covid pandemic -19, 
I take the opportunity to work while studying, this is because of online learning so I can divide class time and also working time. 
While working, I was trained in fast food handling, taking orders as well as delivering delivery orders such as Foodpanda and Grabfood.
I was also trained to prepare burgers and even marrybrown fried chicken.</p>

<h1 style="color:PaleGoldenrod;">Grabfood Rider</h1>
<p><img src="grabfood.png" alt="Grabfood" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
<p style="background-color:Cornsilk;">
After quitting working at Marrybrown, I was trying to find a new experience i.e. I chose to work on my own as a Grabfood Food Delivery.
This job is very challenging because I used to deliver food in bad weather like storms, unknown places, being chased by dogs and so on.
This can be said to be a risky job as I myself face a variety of unpredictable things. But this is an experience I can get to mature myself.</p>
